      <h3> About me and How Ixa was Born</h3>
      <p>When I was younger, I always knew I wanted to change the world for the better, but didn’t know how</p>
      <p>Guatemala, I would stare for hours at the stars at the terrace, while my mother hanged clothes in the clothing line. Starring at the sky for hours made me discover the power of storytelling through science and technology. When I came to America, seeing my mother struggling with her illness courageously while picking watermelons in a pesticide infested field as an undocumented farmworker, and lack of health resources in poor immigrant and low income families, inspired me to create pathways for aiding help. Most importantly, not seeing diverse characters in cartoons during my childhood helped realize animation, like science needs more diverse characters and medical superheroes. That’s how  <strong>Ixa </strong> was born. Ixa is the strength within me like a superhero power to create characters and stories for the new generation. Stories of resilience, hope but most importantly of action. In a world of challenges, our collective experiences become our stories. What is your story?</p>
